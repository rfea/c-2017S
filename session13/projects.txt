Project code should be:

1. well documented
	class should be commented
	one line explain what the class represents

	every method should be explained. What does it do?

	Don't: explain c++
		x++; // add one to x -> uneccessary
			 // WHY??

	DO: explain your logic

2. Clean, object-oriented code

	Your presentation should describe the architecture of how the code works
		NOT EVERY LINE
	
	10 minute time limit.
	Manage your time.
	Really good idea to end with demo
	if you do the demo, then do the architecture, boring!

	First explain, make sure you don't run out of time
	Second demo

Points
		Clarity
		not everyone is obligated to present
		Difficulty of design
		Is it working?

		What isn't in the repo DOES NOT EXIST

Presentations:
		Don't drive the demo/powerpoint and talk
		Don't look backwards
		At least look at the laptop.
		Try to rehearse
