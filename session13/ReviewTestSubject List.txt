template classes

inheritance

virtual functions

pure virtual functions		virtual f() = 0;

dynamic memory
		Definitely need to know 4 functions:
		1. constructor
		2. destructor
		3. copy constructor
		4. operator =
				Not required on test (but appreciated) copy and swap
		move constructor (C++11) ??? maybe on test

pointers
		int * p;	pointer
		const int * q;		readonly pointer
		int* const s;	pointer locked to one spot
					never initialized this and can't change this
		int* const s = something;

		int x[10];		// x is a int* const pointer
		const int y[10];	// y is const int* const


		x[i] == *(x+i)

		p[-1]		goes one before a pointer
